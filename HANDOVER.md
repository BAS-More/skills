# BAS-More/skills — Active Codex handover

**Status:** ACTIVE
**Updated:** 2026-08-26 (Australia/Melbourne)
**Default branch:** `main`
**Codex thread:** `codex://threads/01a03bc7-0d2a-75e2-8c3e-c9d125ded17e`
**Primary workstream:** semantic MCP/tool-routing benchmark and skills repository maintenance

## Evidence boundary

The Codex thread transcript is not available through this GitHub checkout or the connected repository API. This handover is reconstructed from the current repository, the retained benchmark handover under `docs/mcp-routing-benchmark/`, branches, commits, and PR history. Any thread-local change that was never committed is **not recovered** by this document.

## Executive state

The repository-level skill organization is established and governed by the existing project rules. The most important unfinished work is not ordinary skill curation: it is the routing evaluation documented in:

- `docs/mcp-routing-benchmark/HANDOVER.md`
- `docs/mcp-routing-benchmark/HANDOVER-PROMPT.md`
- `docs/mcp-tool-routing-layer-validation.md`

The research and lexical baselines were completed. The semantic benchmark was not completed because the cloud environment denied access to `huggingface.co`, which prevented the embedding model from being obtained. The retained handover records the measured conclusion that lexical routing does not scale to the real catalogue: on the 412-tool catalogue it reached roughly 21–23% top-1, and real descriptions did not remove that ceiling. The remaining question is whether a genuine semantic backend materially improves the result.

The repository also retains the branch `claude/mcp-tool-calling-layer-9g9q8j`. Do not assume its name means it is the current source of truth. Compare it by content against `main` before reusing or deleting it.

## Completed and preserved

- A real-catalogue routing study and lexical/control baselines exist.
- The benchmark documents record two scorer/harness defects that once produced near-zero results and were corrected:
  - missing workload-prefix normalization;
  - a parser that failed on newline-delimited JSON.
- The research records a critical diagnostic rule: when a gateway scores near zero, validate the scorer before blaming the gateway.
- A control path is specified: semantic BGE and non-semantic hash runs must be executed together so any gain is attributable to semantics rather than hybrid plumbing.
- Repository skill buckets and publication rules remain governed by `CLAUDE-PROJECT-RULES.md`.

## Unfinished work, in priority order

### P0 — recover the exact execution environment

1. From a clean clone, record:
   ```bash
   git status --short
   git branch --show-current
   git log --oneline -5
   git remote -v
   gh pr list --state open
   ```
2. Compare `claude/mcp-tool-calling-layer-9g9q8j` with `main` by content:
   ```bash
   git fetch --all --prune
   git diff --stat origin/main...origin/claude/mcp-tool-calling-layer-9g9q8j
   git log --left-right --cherry-pick --oneline origin/main...origin/claude/mcp-tool-calling-layer-9g9q8j
   ```
3. Preserve any unique work before branch cleanup. A merged PR status is not enough; verify files and commits.

### P1 — clear or accurately report the semantic-model blocker

The existing benchmark handover says the cloud egress proxy denied `huggingface.co`. At the start of a new session, test the blocker once using the documented bootstrap path. Do not repeatedly retry, tunnel around policy, change download hosts without review, or label a policy denial as a product failure.

If the denial remains, set this handover to `BLOCKED` and record the exact command, exit status, and denial message. The user must change the cloud environment policy in the UI; a running session cannot retroactively acquire that permission.

### P2 — run the semantic and control evaluations together

Once the embedding model is genuinely available, run from the benchmark directory using the retained commands:

```bash
THV=/tmp/thv EMBED_PYTHON=/tmp/embvenv/bin/python ./run-semantic.sh bge tokens
THV=/tmp/thv EMBED_PYTHON=/tmp/embvenv/bin/python ./run-semantic.sh hash tokens
```

For each run, record:

- backend and model;
- exact commit and configuration;
- top-1 and any other agreed metrics;
- empty-result rate;
- embedding request count;
- tool-surface overhead;
- errors and exclusions.

A semantic run with **zero embedding requests is invalid**, regardless of its score.

### P3 — interpret without tuning to the answer

Do not tune the query set, labels, catalogue, or `hybridSearchSemanticRatio` to make semantic search look better. Report disappointing numbers plainly. The decision is whether semantics beats the measured lexical ceiling under a fixed protocol, not whether the benchmark can be optimized after observing the result.

### P4 — close the research loop in the repository

Update `docs/mcp-tool-routing-layer-validation.md` with:

- the exact two-run comparison;
- whether semantic routing materially beats lexical;
- operational costs and failure modes;
- recommendation: ship, reject, or run a named follow-up;
- reproducible commands and environment details.

Then update the benchmark handover and this root handover. If no engineering work remains, change `Status:` to `COMPLETE`.

## Validation and repository rules

Before committing skill changes, verify the repository publication invariants:

- every skill in `engineering/`, `productivity/`, or `misc/` is linked from the top-level `README.md`;
- every promoted skill appears in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`;
- `personal/`, `in-progress/`, and `deprecated/` skills do not appear in those public indexes;
- each bucket README lists each skill with a link to its `SKILL.md`.

Run the benchmark-specific checks documented beside the scripts. Do not use a generic green exit as proof that embeddings were exercised.

## Traps already paid for

- `pkill -f <pattern>` can kill the shell running it.
- A network policy change is normally read at session start; changing policy does not repair an already-running cloud session.
- Marketing claims are not implementation evidence.
- Counts alone are weak: two configurations can expose the same number of tools while exposing different server names.
- Do not commit model caches, tokens, credentials, virtual environments, or generated benchmark bulk unless the repository explicitly tracks them.

## Definition of done

This handover may be marked `COMPLETE` only when:

1. unique branch/thread work is either merged, intentionally archived, or explicitly declared unrecoverable;
2. the semantic backend ran and made non-zero embedding requests, or the owner formally closes the experiment without it;
3. semantic and hash controls were run under the same fixed protocol;
4. results and recommendation are committed to the validation document;
5. repository indexes and plugin manifest are consistent;
6. the final commit and PR are pushed and all required checks are green or their limitations are explicitly accepted.

## Handover maintenance

On every meaningful session stop, update this file and `HANDOVER-PROMPT.md` in the same commit. Keep the detailed benchmark handover for experiment-specific commands, but make this root file the single active status index.


## Independent project-memory templates — 2026-09-14

Avi separately requests the comprehensive MAH graph workflow across existing
repositories, with an offer for future projects. This independently requested
documentation work does not replace or complete the original ACTIVE semantic
routing benchmark.

Branch: `codex/project-memory-bootstrap-20260914`, based on skills commit `f980d479e904f3e2ee74db4534d7c291b00887db`.
Deliverables: `docs/project-memory/README.md`, `AGENTS.template.md` and
`GLOBAL.template.md` in that directory. They define an agent-readable bootstrap
policy, routine graph usage, nine-view coverage, privacy, acceptance criteria and
the user-level future-project offer.

Reference MAH: `688eee19709632f1a5fb6900184ff89217dddea1`; analyzer:
`557277c88feafbfd8b232ceacfda59d64b61ef81`.
The MAH implementation is project-specific. These templates do not supply a
generic executable installer, install tools on any computer, enroll repositories
or guarantee arbitrary agents comply. Source factoring, per-stack adapters,
pilot validation, individual target PRs and client configuration remain.

Read-only preparation used GitHub API equivalents for repository HEAD, tree and
open-PR inspection; no local Git worktree or project command was available because
the execution environment failed initialization. Reviewed the templates and
their source references; no runtime/installer/application test is claimed.
Existing skill buckets/public indexes and benchmark files are unchanged.

Continuation: read docs/project-memory/README.md and preserve the independent
ACTIVE workstream. Once an authorized execution host is available, implement and
validate the shared installer before representing this as automatic setup.
Keep the target repository's existing instructions, hooks and source data intact.
