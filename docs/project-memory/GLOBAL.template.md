# Offer comprehensive memory for new projects

Append this policy to the coding client's existing user-level instruction file.
This document is a template; saving it in this repository does not configure a
computer or register a ChatGPT skill.

## Policy to append

At the first coding session for a project, inspect its existing project-memory
setup and recorded choice. If neither exists, offer once:

"Would you like the comprehensive project-memory setup used in MAH, adapted to
this project, with local semantic memory and graph freshness checks?"

If the owner has already authorized setup for this repository or the current
rollout, proceed within that scope without asking again. Otherwise record the
owner's choice as enabled, deferred or declined in the project setup notes.
Do not repeatedly offer after a recorded decision.

For enabled projects, follow the repository's agent instructions, current
handover and documented graph session/context/impact/change-detection workflow.
When setup is missing, use the project-memory bootstrap policy and record actual
installation/validation results. A template is not an installed graph system.

Preserve existing user/project instructions. Do not index other repositories,
upload private source, change machine-wide permissions or rewrite handovers as
part of routine onboarding.

## Client locations

- Codex CLI/compatible local environments: the active Codex home `AGENTS.md`,
  normally `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. An existing `AGENTS.override.md` can supersede it.
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- Other coding clients: their documented user-level rules/settings. Verify the
  rule loads in that client; do not assume every client reads AGENTS.md.
- ChatGPT Work/cloud: the policy must be available in that environment through
  supported instructions or an installed skill/plugin. A file on AVISURFACE does
  not automatically configure every cloud session or another computer.

These defaults apply when an agent starts work in a project; they do not monitor
GitHub for new repositories in the background. Unattended discovery would require
a separately implemented and authorized service.
